## Dependencies

At current, the GNU Makefile used to build this software is Debian-dependent. This means you'll need a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution to build this software properly (such as Debian, Ubuntu, Tails, Kali Linux etc.).

- [x] `gawk` - Used for regular expressions checking during the build process.
- [ ] `libncurses-dev` - Used for the TUI environment.
- [x] `bash` - A commonly-used shell.

Those dependencies marked as ☑️ are hopefully only temporary, until better solutions can be found.
